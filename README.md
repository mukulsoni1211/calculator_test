# Calcultor app
## This is the test task, In which we have created calculator for the addition only.

## In order to run the specs, You need to install rspec library.

# `gem install rspec` 

## To run the specs, Go to the calculators directory then run:-
 
# `rspec calculator_spec.rb`

**_NOTE:_** The script is only available for addition only, We will add further later.
